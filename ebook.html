  <!----Preface---->
  <h1>
    <a name="pref">Preface</a>
  </h1>
  <p>I am a retired academic who has spent 40 years teaching and researching
    computer science. More than 15 years ago I attended the 7th World Wide
    Web Conference in Brisbane, Australia. I saw a demonstration of a web browser
    showing a page that allowed the user to edit the page content directly
    in that browser. I was well and truly hooked.</p>
  <p>This was my introduction to what became known as Web 2.0. Later still
    we called it AJAX after the mix of technology used. Then the marketers
    started calling it The Cloud. Back in the 1990s though we always drew the
    Internet as a cloud shape in diagrams. It's not surprising, therefore,
    that the Cloud has become a metaphor for the Internet.</p>
  <p>Today when talking about the Cloud we mean the process by which people
    access software, computer processing, and files over the Web, instead of
    on their desktops. Over those more than 15 years I have reveled in the
    Cloud, using it for both professional purposes and in my everyday life.</p>
  <p>As you might guess I use the Cloud for very many things but to give you
    a flavor my uses include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>email, contacts, calendar and task reminders -- personal information</li>
    <li>storing document and data files of all kinds</li>
    <li>collecting and editing media such as photos, audio and video</li>
    <li>social media sites like blogs, Twitter, Google+ and LinkedIn</li>
    <li>specialist collections of notes, slides, links, and references</li>
    <li>and, believe it or not some software development directly on the Cloud.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When I praise the Cloud to my friends and colleagues I am often asked
    "What is the Cloud and why is it so useful? I dedcided to answer by creating
    an online course, from which this ebook has been created. In a couple of
    hours of your time you will learn about the main features of the Cloud
    and how you, too, can use it to accomplish everyday tasks.</p>
  <p>No matter whether you are an individual, a professional or work for a
    company, I hope you enjoy what you read here, especially if you complete
    the practical workshops included in this book. It's all about the Cloud
    and you.</p>
  <!------------Chapter 01------------>

  <h1>
    <a name="0101">Introduction</a>
  </h1>
  <p>This course introduces the Cloud and how it relates to you in your everyday
    life.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.01.01------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010101devices.png">
  <p>Many of us have access to a range of devices such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Smartphones</li>
    <li>Tablets</li>
    <li>Laptops, and</li>
    <li>Desktop computers.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All these devices are capable of connecting to the Cloud to bring us a
    wide range of facilities as we conduct our daily lives.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.01.02------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010102internetconnect.png">
  <p>Your device you must be connected to the Internet to access the Cloud.</p>
  <p>The Cloud features are managed by a very large set of servers numbering
    in the millions operated by a large range of companies big and small.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.01.03------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010103servers.png">
  <p>Servers are specialized computers containing processors, local memory
    and fast network adapters to connect them to the Cloud.</p>
  <p>For the sake of efficiency large collections of servers are typically
    housed in data centers.</p>
  <p>Software running on the servers provides a large range of useful services
    to the user devices connected to the Cloud.</p>
  <p>Often large, coordinated groups of individual servers work together to
    provide the Cloud services</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.01.04------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010104services.png">
  <p>Probably the most widely used service today is secure Cloud storage for
    documents and data of all kinds.</p>
  <p>High capacity disk drives are present in very large numbers housed alongside
    the servers in the data centers to provide this vital Cloud storage service.</p>
  <p>Once stored in the Cloud documents and data can be accessed from any device
    connected to the Internet given the correct security credentials.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.01.05------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010105storage.png">
  <p>The good news is that the large scale of Cloud services and the increasingly
    convenient access to the Internet has driven down the cost of access.</p>
  <p>Enterprise users have been able to access the Cloud for some time, but
    this course focuses particularly on how individuals, professionals and
    small businesses can gain benefits from the Cloud.</p>
  <p>I look forward to explaining how the Cloud and You can work together.</p>
  <!------------Section
  01.02------------>
  <h1>
    <a name="0102">Connecting to the Cloud</a>
  </h1>
  <p>Now you are familiar with the main Cloud components let's see how to connect
    with the Cloud. On all the devices mentioned so far you can run a web browser
    to connect with the vast majority of cloud services.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.02.01------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010201browser.png">
  <p>It's a simple matter of entering the address of the cloud service into
    your browser's address field.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.02.02------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010202address.png">
  <p>Remember the Web and the Internet are quite different things</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.02.03------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010203internet.png">
  <p>The Internet is a network of networks connecting devices with unique Internet
    Protocol, IP addresses. It allows data to be exchanged between, say, your
    smartphone and a Cloud server.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.02.04------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010204web.png">
  <p>In contrast the Web uses HyperText Transfer Protocol, HTTP, to communicate
    between the browser on a device and a specialist Web server in the Cloud.</p>
  <p>Here we see two of the most popular Cloud storage services, Google Drive
    and OneDrive from Microsoft. Google Drive is being used on a tablet and
    OneDrive on a laptop.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.02.05------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010205sites.png">
  <p>Cloud service will usually detect the browser and device and alter the
    displayed contents accordingly.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.02.06------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010206phones.png">
  <p>To make the interface more convenient many Cloud services provide dedicated
    apps. On the left is a dedicated smartphone app for OneDrive. On the right
    we see the same OneDrive account being displayed in a browser on a smartphone.</p>
  <p>To enable dedicated apps, most professional Cloud services offer an alternative
    to browser access called an API or Application Programming Interface. This
    is an acronym you will see often in connection with the Cloud. An API is
    used by apps running on a device to access the specific Cloud service.
    All apps that share data between devices or other users will make use of
    the Cloud, and as such can be called Cloud apps.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.02.07------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010207api.png">
  <p>Of course where data and files are shared there is the need for an access
    authorization system. Typically a user name and password security system
    is used to grant you access to your Cloud data, and for you to control
    data sharing, if needed.</p>
  <p>In summary, connecting to the Cloud is as simple as typing an address
    into a browser or running a special app on your device. A system of user
    names and passwords makes access to the Cloud secure.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.02.08------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010208login.png">
  <!------------Section 01.03------------>
  <h1>
    <a name="0103">Benefits of the Cloud</a>
  </h1>
  <p>Now you have an overview of the main Cloud components let's look at the
    question of why the Cloud is so useful.</p>
  <p>Put simply there are three compelling reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access from any device on the Internet</li>
    <li>One safe place for apps, documents and services</li>
    <li>Share documents and data with anyone</li>
  </ul>
  <!----------Diagram-01.03.01---------->
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010301benefits.png">
  <p>Let me look at each one in turn.</p>
  <p>I have mentioned the large range of different Internet-connected devices
    that can access the Cloud. They literally number in the billions so wherever
    you are on the globe you can use your own or someone else's device for
    access.</p>
  <p>The browser or Cloud app can detect the device type and show content to
    accommodate the screen size and touch interface. Since browser access is
    immediate the Cloud service can always display the latest version. There
    is no need for the continual and often annoying process of downloading
    and installing updated versions of apps.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.03.02------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010302onelocation.png">
  <p>You can think of the Cloud as a single location, even though the services,
    documents and data are likely to be spread across different servers in
    different data centers possibly even in different countries.</p>
  <p>To you the Cloud is a single, albeit nebulous, place. As such it is well
    named.</p>
  <p>The distributed nature of the servers and disk storage also gives us security
    against data loss. Providers of Cloud services deliberately keep multiple
    copies of your documents and data. At the same time this affords a backup
    service and protects against hardware failure.</p>
  <p>The Cloud gives you access to your own documents and data from all your
    devices. This is device sharing. In addition most Cloud services also allow
    you to share access with other people you specify, or even make your documents
    and data accessible to all.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.03.03------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010303sharing.png">
  <p>Granting read access allows you distribute information to all and sundry
    – you become your own publisher. Most powerfully of all is when you grant
    edit access to others – they can then share the information creation process
    with you. Teams and organisations find shared editing a vital tool particularly
    with customers.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.03.04------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010304working.png">
  <p>To obtain the major benefits I listed you must change your approach to
    computing. You should no longer be tied to a particular computing device
    at home or work where your data is stored by apps you have to download
    and install. Sadly it is probable you rarely, if ever, backup these particular
    computers. Even if you back up consistently you are no longer tied to backing
    up your documents and data and storing the backups in a single remote location.
    Instead you can perform your computing tasks and access your documents
    from any of your devices connected to the Cloud. Backup comes for free.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.03.05------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010305summary.png">
  <!------------Section 01.04------------>
  <h1>
    <a name="0104">Pitfalls of the Cloud</a>
  </h1>
  <p>I have listed the considerable benefits of the Cloud, but as always these
    come with some associated risks.</p>
  <p>You must understand the potential pitfalls in order weigh up if the Cloud
    is for you at the end of the day.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.04.01------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010401pitfalls.png">
  <p>Again being brief there are three significant pitfalls:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You need an Internet connection</li>
    <li>You must trust the Cloud service providers to stay in business</li>
    <li>You should assess the security of data transfer and storage</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Let me look at each one in turn.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.01.02------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010402internet.png">
  <p>You must access the Cloud via the Internet so you need an Internet connection
    for each transaction or task. However the connection does not have to be
    continuous. Indeed a browser only connects to the Cloud when it has a transaction
    to carry out.</p>
  <p>For example when checking for email messages the browser connects and
    receives a list of messages. Only when the user wants to read, delete or
    send a new message does the browser connect again. If the Internet connection
    goes down then a delay occurs until it is available once more, annoying
    but the transaction recovers when connection is possible.</p>
  <p>In many countries, with increasing availability of mobile phone networks
    and Wi-Fi, Internet access is becoming ubiquitous making the use of the
    Cloud more and more feasible.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.04.03------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010403trust.png">
  <p>Just as with Internet services there are many companies providing Cloud
    services both big and small. When you use free or paid Cloud services from
    a company you must judge the likelihood of their service being reliable
    and long lasting. Some small Cloud service companies have ceased operating,
    as have individual services from large companies like Google. All will
    give a lead time to allow you to copy your data to a competing service.</p>
  <p>Many Cloud service providers are small startups who are eventually taken
    over by larger companies that either continue the service or provide similar
    ones. Individuals, professionals and small businesses in particular, should
    have a plan to switch Cloud services when there is a heavy reliance on
    one particular service. This is a major point of difference to locally
    installed software and data that will stay on a local computer even if
    the software is no longer updated and supported.</p>
  <p>Security is the most common criticism heard against the adoption of the
    Cloud and there are two aspects, data transport through the Internet and
    data storage security.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.04.05------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010405security.png">
  <p>Let's start with data transport between the device and the Cloud. By design
    Internet Protocol passes data packets through intermediate servers. Each
    server can keep a copy of the data packet and inspect its contents. Fortunately
    using secure HTTP, called HTTPS, data is encrypted as it passes through
    the Internet and arrives safely.</p>
  <p>For data storage security we have to trust the Cloud service providers
    to encrypt our passwords and documents. Despite rare lapses today's commercial
    Cloud service providers offer a very high level of data storage security.</p>
  <p>A third aspect of Cloud security that usually affects only large organisations
    is the geographical location of their Cloud storage. The location affects
    whether local law enforcement agencies can demand copies of documents and
    data stored in the Cloud. As well some government organisations are legally
    constrained to hold their data in their country of operations. If these
    are concerns you must only use a Cloud service provider that can guarantee
    the geographical security you require.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.04.06------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010406summary.png">
  <p>To summarise, there are some downsides to the Cloud:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An Internet connection is needed, at least intermittently.</li>
    <li>You must trust that a Cloud service is reliable and long lasting, or have
      a plan B.</li>
    <li>Cloud security requires careful consideration of the risks both in data
      transport and data storage and its location.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Nevertheless in my judgment and experience the risks for individuals,
    professionals and small business are low enough to make use of the Cloud
    worthwhile.</p>
  <!------------Section-01.05------------>
  <h1>
    <a name="0105">Cloud Services</a>
  </h1>
  <!------------Diagram-010501------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/xxx.png">
  <p>Having covered the benefits and pitfalls of the Cloud I would like to
    mention a few of the more important Cloud services selected from the thousands
    available today.</p>
  <p>Several of these Cloud services will be useful in your day-to-day activities.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.05.02------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010502email.png">
  <p>As I mentioned, online email was the genesis of the Cloud, and many large
    companies offer Cloud email services. I show Outlook.com, a part of Microsoft's
    OneDrive, and the successor to Hotmail which was one of the first and largest
    of the email services. Other major competitors are Yahoo mail, Google mail
    and Apple's iCloud with a host of other companies in their wake. Of course,
    virtually every Internet Service Provider also gives their users access
    to web mail.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.05.03------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010503storage.png">
  <p>I will cover Cloud storage in later lectures but it is the next most important
    service after email. The very popular Dropbox is shown here. Like several
    competing services it offers storage for all file types with a generic
    file system user interface typical of Windows Explorer and Mac Finder.
    Dropbox runs across all the devices I have discussed, and provides the
    typical synchronization and backup capability expected of such services.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.05.04------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010504media.png">
  <p>Storing media files like photos, music and video is just a special variant
    of Cloud storage. The features of the user interface experience in the
    browser are tailored to the different types of media involved. Here on
    Yahoo’s Flickr, a venerable site for storing photos, the features of the
    service for storing and sharing photos are extensive. This is a vey important
    photo service since Flickr now offers 1 terabyte of Cloud storage for free,
    that’s a cool one thousand gigabytes!</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.05.05------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010505office.png">
  <p>Again I will cover Cloud office apps more fully in a later lecture.  
    Most users today receive email attachments in popular document formats
    from Microsoft Office, particularly Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents.
      Being able to read and create these formats in the Cloud is a popular
    service. Microsoft offers Cloud app equivalents to Word, Excel and PowerPoint
    via OneDrive. Another major competitor in this space is Google Apps.  
    Snippets of data like notes, addresses, images, screen dumps, voice narration
    and so on, are difficult to store cohesively and find again later.   This
    has led to development of specific Cloud notes apps like the leader Evernote,
    and Microsoft’s OneNote.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-01.05.06------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010506data.png">
  <p>A structured data repository is just a flowery term for a database resident
    in the Cloud where users can create and edit data records, and then search
    for them intelligently at a later date. The interface presented in the
    browser or Cloud app is carefully designed to be convenient for the type
    of data stored in the collection. I show the Diigo Cloud service used to
    store web links with associated labels and descriptions. Diigo goes much
    further allowing you to store whole web page content for reading later,
    annotating parts of pages and sharing any or all of this with other users.
    Academic references curated on Mendeley, and slide shows stored on SlideShare
    are a couple more common examples of structured data.</p>
  <p>Online shopping and financial services are Cloud services I will mention
    in a later lecture. The list of services is still far from exhausted, but
    it would probably take a whole course to do justice to the full range of
    Cloud services. Suffice it to say there are few computing tasks that cannot
    be undertaken successfully in the Cloud. These days you would have to mount
    a special case to avoid the use of Cloud services.</p>
