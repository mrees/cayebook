<!----Preface---->
<h1>
  <a name="pref">Preface</a>
</h1>
<p>I am a retired academic who has spent 40 years teaching and researching
  computer science. More than 15 years ago I attended the 7th World Wide
  Web Conference in Brisbane, Australia. I saw a demonstration of a web browser
  showing a page that allowed the user to edit the page content directly
  in that browser. I was well and truly hooked.</p>
<p>This was my introduction to what became known as Web 2.0. Later still
  we called it AJAX after the mix of technology used. Then the marketers
  started calling it The Cloud. Back in the 1990s though we always drew the
  Internet as a cloud shape in diagrams. It's not surprising, therefore,
  that the Cloud has become a metaphor for the Internet.</p>
<p>Today when talking about the Cloud we mean the process by which people
  access software, computer processing, and files over the Web, instead of
  on their desktops. Over those more than 15 years I have reveled in the
  Cloud, using it for both professional purposes and in my everyday life.</p>
<p>As you might guess I use the Cloud for very many things but to give you
  a flavor my uses include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>email, contacts, calendar and task reminders -- personal information</li>
  <li>storing document and data files of all kinds</li>
  <li>collecting and editing media such as photos, audio and video</li>
  <li>social media sites like blogs, Twitter, Google+ and LinkedIn</li>
  <li>specialist collections of notes, slides, links, and references</li>
  <li>and, believe it or not some software development directly on the Cloud.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I praise the Cloud to my friends and colleagues I am often asked
  "What is the Cloud and why is it so useful? I dedcided to answer by creating
  an online course, from which this ebook has been created. In a couple of
  hours of your time you will learn about the main features of the Cloud
  and how you, too, can use it to accomplish everyday tasks.</p>
<p>No matter whether you are an individual, a professional or work for a
  company, I hope you enjoy what you read here, especially if you complete
  the practical workshops included in this book. It's all about the Cloud
  and you.</p>
<!------------Chapter 01------------>
<!------------Section 01.01------------>
<h1>
  <a name="0101">Introduction</a>
</h1>
<p>This course introduces the Cloud and how it relates to you in your everyday
  life.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.01.01------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010101devices.png">
<p>Many of us have access to a range of devices such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Smartphones</li>
  <li>Tablets</li>
  <li>Laptops, and</li>
  <li>Desktop computers.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these devices are capable of connecting to the Cloud to bring us a
  wide range of facilities as we conduct our daily lives.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.01.02------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010102internetconnect.png">
<p>Your device you must be connected to the Internet to access the Cloud.</p>
<p>The Cloud features are managed by a very large set of servers numbering
  in the millions operated by a large range of companies big and small.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.01.03------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010103servers.png">
<p>Servers are specialized computers containing processors, local memory
  and fast network adapters to connect them to the Cloud.</p>
<p>For the sake of efficiency large collections of servers are typically
  housed in data centers.</p>
<p>Software running on the servers provides a large range of useful services
  to the user devices connected to the Cloud.</p>
<p>Often large, coordinated groups of individual servers work together to
  provide the Cloud services</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.01.04------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010104services.png">
<p>Probably the most widely used service today is secure Cloud storage for
  documents and data of all kinds.</p>
<p>High capacity disk drives are present in very large numbers housed alongside
  the servers in the data centers to provide this vital Cloud storage service.</p>
<p>Once stored in the Cloud documents and data can be accessed from any device
  connected to the Internet given the correct security credentials.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.01.05------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010105storage.png">
<p>The good news is that the large scale of Cloud services and the increasingly
  convenient access to the Internet has driven down the cost of access.</p>
<p>Enterprise users have been able to access the Cloud for some time, but
  this course focuses particularly on how individuals, professionals and
  small businesses can gain benefits from the Cloud.</p>
<p>I look forward to explaining how the Cloud and You can work together.</p>
<!------------Section
01.02------------>
<h1>
  <a name="0102">Connecting to the Cloud</a>
</h1>
<p>Now you are familiar with the main Cloud components let's see how to connect
  with the Cloud. On all the devices mentioned so far you can run a web browser
  to connect with the vast majority of cloud services.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.02.01------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010201browser.png">
<p>It's a simple matter of entering the address of the cloud service into
  your browser's address field.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.02.02------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010202address.png">
<p>Remember the Web and the Internet are quite different things</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.02.03------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010203internet.png">
<p>The Internet is a network of networks connecting devices with unique Internet
  Protocol, IP addresses. It allows data to be exchanged between, say, your
  smartphone and a Cloud server.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.02.04------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010204web.png">
<p>In contrast the Web uses HyperText Transfer Protocol, HTTP, to communicate
  between the browser on a device and a specialist Web server in the Cloud.</p>
<p>Here we see two of the most popular Cloud storage services, Google Drive
  and OneDrive from Microsoft. Google Drive is being used on a tablet and
  OneDrive on a laptop.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.02.05------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010205sites.png">
<p>Cloud service will usually detect the browser and device and alter the
  displayed contents accordingly.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.02.06------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010206phones.png">
<p>To make the interface more convenient many Cloud services provide dedicated
  apps. On the left is a dedicated smartphone app for OneDrive. On the right
  we see the same OneDrive account being displayed in a browser on a smartphone.</p>
<p>To enable dedicated apps, most professional Cloud services offer an alternative
  to browser access called an API or Application Programming Interface. This
  is an acronym you will see often in connection with the Cloud. An API is
  used by apps running on a device to access the specific Cloud service.
  All apps that share data between devices or other users will make use of
  the Cloud, and as such can be called Cloud apps.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.02.07------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010207api.png">
<p>Of course where data and files are shared there is the need for an access
  authorization system. Typically a user name and password security system
  is used to grant you access to your Cloud data, and for you to control
  data sharing, if needed.</p>
<p>In summary, connecting to the Cloud is as simple as typing an address
  into a browser or running a special app on your device. A system of user
  names and passwords makes access to the Cloud secure.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.02.08------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010208login.png">
<!------------Section 01.03------------>
<h1>
  <a name="0103">Benefits of the Cloud</a>
</h1>
<p>Now you have an overview of the main Cloud components let's look at the
  question of why the Cloud is so useful.</p>
<p>Put simply there are three compelling reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Access from any device on the Internet</li>
  <li>One safe place for apps, documents and services</li>
  <li>Share documents and data with anyone</li>
</ul>
<!----------Diagram-01.03.01---------->
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010301benefits.png">
<p>Let me look at each one in turn.</p>
<p>I have mentioned the large range of different Internet-connected devices
  that can access the Cloud. They literally number in the billions so wherever
  you are on the globe you can use your own or someone else's device for
  access.</p>
<p>The browser or Cloud app can detect the device type and show content to
  accommodate the screen size and touch interface. Since browser access is
  immediate the Cloud service can always display the latest version. There
  is no need for the continual and often annoying process of downloading
  and installing updated versions of apps.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.03.02------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010302onelocation.png">
<p>You can think of the Cloud as a single location, even though the services,
  documents and data are likely to be spread across different servers in
  different data centers possibly even in different countries.</p>
<p>To you the Cloud is a single, albeit nebulous, place. As such it is well
  named.</p>
<p>The distributed nature of the servers and disk storage also gives us security
  against data loss. Providers of Cloud services deliberately keep multiple
  copies of your documents and data. At the same time this affords a backup
  service and protects against hardware failure.</p>
<p>The Cloud gives you access to your own documents and data from all your
  devices. This is device sharing. In addition most Cloud services also allow
  you to share access with other people you specify, or even make your documents
  and data accessible to all.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.03.03------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010303sharing.png">
<p>Granting read access allows you distribute information to all and sundry.
  You become your own publisher. Most powerfully of all is when you grant
  edit access to others as they can then share the information creation process
  with you. Teams and organisations find shared editing a vital tool particularly
  with customers.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.03.04------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010304working.png">
<p>To obtain the major benefits I listed you must change your approach to
  computing. You should no longer be tied to a particular computing device
  at home or work where your data is stored by apps you have to download
  and install. Sadly it is probable you rarely, if ever, backup these particular
  computers. Even if you back up consistently you are no longer tied to backing
  up your documents and data and storing the backups in a single remote location.
  Instead you can perform your computing tasks and access your documents
  from any of your devices connected to the Cloud. Backup comes for free.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.03.05------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010305summary.png">
<!------------Section 01.04------------>
<h1>
  <a name="0104">Pitfalls of the Cloud</a>
</h1>
<p>I have listed the considerable benefits of the Cloud, but as always these
  come with some associated risks.</p>
<p>You must understand the potential pitfalls in order weigh up if the Cloud
  is for you at the end of the day.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.04.01------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010401pitfalls.png">
<p>Again being brief there are three significant pitfalls:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You need an Internet connection</li>
  <li>You must trust the Cloud service providers to stay in business</li>
  <li>You should assess the security of data transfer and storage</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me look at each one in turn.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.01.02------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010402internet.png">
<p>You must access the Cloud via the Internet so you need an Internet connection
  for each transaction or task. However the connection does not have to be
  continuous. Indeed a browser only connects to the Cloud when it has a transaction
  to carry out.</p>
<p>For example when checking for email messages the browser connects and
  receives a list of messages. Only when the user wants to read, delete or
  send a new message does the browser connect again. If the Internet connection
  goes down then a delay occurs until it is available once more, annoying
  but the transaction recovers when connection is possible.</p>
<p>In many countries, with increasing availability of mobile phone networks
  and Wi-Fi, Internet access is becoming ubiquitous making the use of the
  Cloud more and more feasible.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.04.03------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010403trust.png">
<p>Just as with Internet services there are many companies providing Cloud
  services both big and small. When you use free or paid Cloud services from
  a company you must judge the likelihood of their service being reliable
  and long lasting. Some small Cloud service companies have ceased operating,
  as have individual services from large companies like Google. All will
  give a lead time to allow you to copy your data to a competing service.</p>
<p>Many Cloud service providers are small startups who are eventually taken
  over by larger companies that either continue the service or provide similar
  ones. Individuals, professionals and small businesses in particular, should
  have a plan to switch Cloud services when there is a heavy reliance on
  one particular service. This is a major point of difference to locally
  installed software and data that will stay on a local computer even if
  the software is no longer updated and supported.</p>
<p>Security is the most common criticism heard against the adoption of the
  Cloud and there are two aspects, data transport through the Internet and
  data storage security.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.04.05------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010405security.png">
<p>Let's start with data transport between the device and the Cloud. By design
  Internet Protocol passes data packets through intermediate servers. Each
  server can keep a copy of the data packet and inspect its contents. Fortunately
  using secure HTTP, called HTTPS, data is encrypted as it passes through
  the Internet and arrives safely.</p>
<p>For data storage security we have to trust the Cloud service providers
  to encrypt our passwords and documents. Despite rare lapses today's commercial
  Cloud service providers offer a very high level of data storage security.</p>
<p>A third aspect of Cloud security that usually affects only large organisations
  is the geographical location of their Cloud storage. The location affects
  whether local law enforcement agencies can demand copies of documents and
  data stored in the Cloud. As well some government organisations are legally
  constrained to hold their data in their country of operations. If these
  are concerns you must only use a Cloud service provider that can guarantee
  the geographical security you require.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.04.06------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010406summary.png">
<p>To summarise, there are some downsides to the Cloud:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An Internet connection is needed, at least intermittently.</li>
  <li>You must trust that a Cloud service is reliable and long lasting, or have
    a plan B.</li>
  <li>Cloud security requires careful consideration of the risks both in data
    transport and data storage and its location.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless in my judgment and experience the risks for individuals,
  professionals and small business are low enough to make use of the Cloud
  worthwhile.</p>
<!------------Section-01.05------------>
<h1>
  <a name="0105">Cloud Services</a>
</h1>
<!------------Diagram-010501------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010501services.png">
<p>Having covered the benefits and pitfalls of the Cloud I would like to
  mention a few of the more important Cloud services selected from the thousands
  available today.</p>
<p>Several of these Cloud services will be useful in your day-to-day activities.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.05.02------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010502email.png">
<p>As I mentioned, online email was the genesis of the Cloud, and many large
  companies offer Cloud email services. I show Outlook.com, a part of Microsoft's
  OneDrive, and the successor to Hotmail which was one of the first and largest
  of the email services. Other major competitors are Yahoo mail, Google mail
  and Apple's iCloud with a host of other companies in their wake. Of course,
  virtually every Internet Service Provider also gives their users access
  to web mail.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.05.03------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010503storage.png">
<p>I will cover Cloud storage in later lectures but it is the next most important
  service after email. The very popular Dropbox is shown here. Like several
  competing services it offers storage for all file types with a generic
  file system user interface typical of Windows Explorer and Mac Finder.
  Dropbox runs across all the devices I have discussed, and provides the
  typical synchronization and backup capability expected of such services.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.05.04------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010504media.png">
<p>Storing media files like photos, music and video is just a special variant
  of Cloud storage. The features of the user interface experience in the
  browser are tailored to the different types of media involved. Here on
  Yahoo Flickr, a venerable site for storing photos, the features of the
  service for storing and sharing photos are extensive. This is a vey important
  photo service since Flickr now offers 1 terabyte of Cloud storage for free,
  that's a cool one thousand gigabytes!</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.05.05------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010505office.png">
<p>Again I will cover Cloud office apps more fully in a later lecture. Most
  users today receive email attachments in popular document formats from
  Microsoft Office, particularly Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents. Being
  able to read and create these formats in the Cloud is a popular service.
  Microsoft offers Cloud app equivalents to Word, Excel and PowerPoint via
  OneDrive. Another major competitor in this space is Google Apps. Snippets
  of data like notes, addresses, images, screen dumps, voice narration and
  so on, are difficult to store cohesively and find again later. This has
  led to development of specific Cloud notes apps like the leader Evernote,
  and Microsoft OneNote.</p>
<!------------Diagram-01.05.06------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/010506data.png">
<p>A structured data repository is just a flowery term for a database resident
  in the Cloud where users can create and edit data records, and then search
  for them intelligently at a later date. The interface presented in the
  browser or Cloud app is carefully designed to be convenient for the type
  of data stored in the collection. I show the Diigo Cloud service used to
  store web links with associated labels and descriptions. Diigo goes much
  further allowing you to store whole web page content for reading later,
  annotating parts of pages and sharing any or all of this with other users.
  Academic references curated on Mendeley, and slide shows stored on SlideShare
  are a couple more common examples of structured data.</p>
<p>Online shopping and financial services are Cloud services I will mention
  in a later lecture. The list of services is still far from exhausted, but
  it would probably take a whole course to do justice to the full range of
  Cloud services. Suffice it to say there are few computing tasks that cannot
  be undertaken successfully in the Cloud. These days you would have to mount
  a special case to avoid the use of Cloud services.</p>
<!------------Section-02.01------------>
<h1>
  <a name="0201">Cloud Storage Features</a>
</h1>
<p>Storage is one of the most popular Cloud services. I will describe the
  facilities in more depth. At the end of this section a short workshop takes
  you through the practical steps to establish and use your own Cloud storage,
  that is if you don't use it already.</p>
<!------------Diagram-02.01.01------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/020101features.png">
<p>Recall that Cloud storage mirrors the main benefits of the Cloud itself.
  You can access your documents and data files from any Internet-connected
  device. The Cloud provides a single, safe place to store your documents.
  Once in the Cloud your documents are private by default but can also be
  shared with others, either specific individuals or the public.</p>
<p>Here I show some files and folders in an example DropBox account. DropBox
  has been operating successfully since 2007. Each free account comes with
  a relatively small 2 GB of storage space with the option to pay for much
  larger storage space. This is a business model adopted by all the major
  Cloud storage providers.</p>
<!------------Diagram-02.01.02------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/020102dropbox.png">
<p>DropBox has been available for several years and has a proven track record
  of providing a reliable service. The screen on the left shows DropBox running
  in a browser on a Windows machine. The pair of screens on the right are
  from a smartphone with the left side being from a browser and the right
  showing a dedicated DropBox app on the same device. DropBox is accessible
  from all the devices I have spoken about.</p>
<p>Two of the key attributes of Cloud storage are shown the diagram. The
  documents are accessible from any device on the Internet, and, the documents
  are stored in one place, safely backed up by the Cloud storage provider.</p>
<!------------Diagram-02.01.03------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/020103pdf.png">
<p>All the previous screens are examples of displaying the list of files
  stored in the Cloud. For common file types, by clicking or touching a file
  name, the contents will be downloaded and displayed on the device. Here
  we see a PDF file being displayed. For special file types, we are prompted
  to download the file to the device as long as there is enough storage space
  available.</p>
<p>On laptop operating systems with a visible file system the Cloud storage
  providers make available server apps that run in the background. These
  apps synchronize documents between a local folder and the Cloud storage.
  Any changes to the documents such as creation, deletion or update are quickly
  synchronized.</p>
<!------------Diagram-02.01.04------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/020104files.png">
<p>This means that you always have a synchronized copy of all your Cloud
  documents on your laptops and desktops. Two major benefits are present,
  firstly you have one or more local backups of your Cloud documents, and
  secondly your documents are the latest versions on all devices.</p>
<!------------Diagram-02.01.05------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/020105downsides.png">
<p>Again there are some inevitable downsides. An Internet connection is required
  at least on a reasonably intermittent basis. The document upload and download
  to maintain synchrony requires high bandwidth especially for large documents.
  This will impact any data caps on your Internet service and will be particularly
  noticeable for Internet connections using mobile phone services. And you
  should know by now that any Cloud service always has to consider security
  and trust issues before using the service.</p>
<p>Once again, I and millions of other users will testify to the benefits
  of Cloud storage outweighing the pitfalls. DropBox has over 200 million
  users currently. Remember with Cloud storage wherever you travel your
  documents go with you even if it is just from one of your devices to another.
  As well as DropBox also look at other prominent services such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft OneDrive with 7 GB of free space</li>
  <li>Google Drive with 15 GB</li>
  <li>Amazon Cloud Drive with 5 GB, and</li>
  <li>Box with 10 GB</li>
</ul>
<p>These free space limits will generally increase over time.</p>
<!------------Section-02.02------------>
<h1>
  <a name="0202">Cloud Storage Management</a>
</h1>

<p>Let us go into a little more depth on how to manage your Cloud storage.
  Once you commit to the Cloud it should be second nature to store and share
  your documents and media files in your Cloud storage services. I deliberately
  use the plural because you will probably end up using at least a couple
  of Cloud storages.</p>
<!------------Diagram-02.02.01------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/020201tasks.png">
<p>As with any file system the Cloud document management tasks are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Uploading documents and files to the Cloud</li>
  <li>Renaming and moving documents in Cloud storage</li>
  <li>Deleting files</li>
</ul>
<p>Increasingly, Cloud storage services are offering the ability to edit
  certain types of documents within the browser or dedicated app running
  on the device. This avoids the need to download the document, edit it with
  a special app, and upload it again. I am sure we all look forward to seeing
  more and more sophisticated, in situ editing of Cloud documents in the
  future.</p>
<!------------Diagram-02.02.02------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/020202upload.png">
<p>It is usual to start with an existing collection of local files stored
  on your various devices particularly laptops and desktops. These files
  must be uploaded to your Cloud storage. Although in most cases some intelligent
  compression is used, it is best to assume uploading 1 GB of files will
  consume 1 GB of the data cap for your Internet service.</p>
<p>Trigger the upload at quiet times in your Internet use, especially if
  a group or family shares your connection. I tend to leave the upload to
  a couple of days before my monthly data cap renews, when I know I have
  some spare capacity and will otherwise lose it.</p>
<p>The simple way is to upload directly from a browser. Most browser uploaders
  now allow you to select multiple files and whole folders to make uploading
  more convenient. Often you can just drag large selections of files or folders
  into the browser dialog as shown here. On a laptop with synchronization
  running, you just copy the files into your local Cloud folder and the synchronization
  app will then begin to upload files to the Cloud.</p>
<p>Having selected a file in your list, DropBox will expose a set of file
  management options including delete, rename, duplicate, download, and move
  to a different folder. New folders can be created and renamed. A significant
  feature of DropBox is versioning which allows you to return the file to
  any past version as we see in the lower window. This is very useful when
  you delete large portions of a file. These lost contents can always be
  recovered.</p>
<!------------Diagram-02.02.03------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/020203sharing.png">
<p>Sharing your Cloud document with others is a very important and unique
  benefit of Cloud storage. DropBox allows you to share whole folders, too.</p>
<p>When you click the sharing link in DropBox a number of sharing options
  appear. You can fill in the email address and message and send a message
  with the document link included. This allows you to kiss goodbye to attaching
  physical copies of documents in emails.</p>
<p>Email though is regarded as so last century, and many users will prefer
  to share documents such as photos and videos, in their social media updates.
  DropBox provides for Twitter and Facebook as you see. A third option copies
  the shared document link to the clipboard and allows you to paste that
  into a web page, a chat box, SMS text or other social media sites. Your
  recipient just clicks on this link to read your document, see your photo
  or video, or listen to your music track. This is the power of the Cloud
  coming to the fore.</p>
<p>There are a couple more features in DropBox that you will meet in the
  workshop.</p>
<p>Although it more than meets the needs of Cloud storage document management
  at present DropBox does not provide in situ editing of documents. This
  is the domain of the Cloud Office apps which I cover in a later section.
  Now is the time for you to gain practical experience with Cloud storage
  in the workshop to come.</p>

<!------------Section-02.03------------>
<h1><a name="0203">Cloud Storage Workshop</a></h1>


<!------------SubSection-02.03.01------------>
<h2><a name="020301">Workshop overview</a></h2>
<p>The steps in this workshop take you through setting up an account on Dropbox,
  uploading some documents and performing some management tasks on those
  documents. You then explore access from multiple devices if you have them
  available. Finally you share a document and retain its link for use in
  a later survey.</p>
<p>Carry out the initial steps on your own laptop if possible to obtain the
  maximum benefit of the local document synchronization.</p>
<p>Note that the last section in this workshop asks you to copy a sharing
  link to a Dropbox photo or image to the clipboard in preparation to pasting
  the link into an answer field of a later survey.</p>
<p>If you are using a computer in a public place like a library, Internet
  cafe or student lab then you can still do the majority of the workshop
  in the Cloud without the local synchronization features. You can still
  complete the survey.</p>
<p>If you already use Dropbox on your own laptop or desktop skip the sections
  that do not apply. Hopefully you still might learn some features of which
  you are not aware.</p>
<!------------SubSection-02.03.02------------>
<h2>
  <a name="020302">Establish a Dropbox account</a>
</h2>
<p>If you already have a Dropbox account skip this section. </p>
<p>When creating
  a Dropbox account in order to complete this workshop bear in mind you may
  become a permanent Dropbox user, so use a sensible name and a valid email
  address, which becomes your Dropbox account name.</p>
<ol>
  <li>In a browser go to https://www.dropbox.com/ and choose the button to Sign
    up, and complete the signup form credentials. This will trigger an email
    from Dropbox urging you to install the Dropbox synchronization server app
    on your laptop or desktop. Ignore this for now.</li>
  <li>With your new Dropbox credentials you will be able to login.</li></ol>
  
  <!------------SubSection-02.03.03------------>
  <h2><a name="020303">Upload a document</a></h2>
<p>Make sure you are logged in to your Dropbox account in a browser. Even
  on a public computer there will be files that you can upload, or you may
  have a USB drive plugged in with your own files stored.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on the Files link at the top left to show your list of Dropbox files,
    which may be empty at this point.</li>
  <li>Note the file management tools which control upload, new folder creation,
    folder sharing and the deleted files list.</li>
  <!------------Diagram-02.03.01------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/020301tools.png">
  <li>Click the Upload tool and then the Choose files button. Choose a document
    file like a PDF, an Office document, or a text file and click Open. Note
    you can select several files for upload in the file selection dialog.</li>
  <li>The file will be uploaded to Dropbox and appear in the list of files.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that you can upload whole folders via the mechanism, and, if you
  have the Explorer or Finder open in another window, you can just drag files
  or folders into the upload dialog to trigger the transfer to Dropbox.</p>
</p>

<!------------SubSection-02.03.04------------>
<h2><a name="020304">Dropbox folders</a></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new folder called Documents by clicking the New folder tool,
    entering the name and pressing Enter.</li>
  <li>In the files list, click the name of your uploaded document, and note
    the dialog which allows you to download and share this document. For now
    just close this dialog by clicking the X.</li>
  <li>Click to the right of the name of that document to select it. Note a further
    series of tools appears:</li>
  <!------------Diagram-02.03.02------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/020302tools.png">
  <li>In this case click on Move, select your newly created folder Documents,
    and click Move. This will move your document to the chosen Dropbox folder.</li>
</ol>
<!------------SubSection-02.03.05------------>
<h2>
  <a name="xxx">Photos</a>
</h2>
</a>
<p>A recent addition to Dropbox introduced special handling for photos.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Upload any image such as a .gif, .jpg or .png file.</li>
  <li>From the files list click on the Photos link on the left. Dropbox will
    scan all your uploaded documents for images and display them accordingly.
    Note you can click the Photos link from Dropbox on any of your other devices
    like a smartphone or tablet allowing you to see your photo collection and
    show them to others.</li>
  <li>Create a new folder called Photos and move the uploaded image file to
    that new folder.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that as with any document you can Rename and Delete any of your documents
  and photos.</p>
  
<!------------SubSection-02.03.06------------>
<h2>
  <a name="020306">Sharing documents</a>
</h2>
<p>Sharing is one of the most important reasons for using Cloud storage like
  Dropbox. You can access your Dropbox documents from the browser from any
  device, your own devices and any other device you can access. Perhaps more
  important still you can share any of your documents or folders with other
  people.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Hover the mouse over the Share link symbol on the right of the document
    you want to share:</li>
  <!------------Diagram-02.03.03------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/020303link.png">
  <li>This brings up the Share dialog:</li>
  <!------------Diagram-02.03.04------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/020304sharing.png">
  <li>First click the Get link button to copy the sharing link to the clipboard,
    open a new browser tag or window, and paste the link into the address field
    to see the document.</li>
  <li>Enter the email address of a friend (or you own email address). Type a
    short message like 'I' am sharing this file with you' and click the Send
    button. Provided email is configured on your device this will send a message
    with the sharing link. The recipient just clicks on the 'Click here to
    view' link to access the document.</li>
  <li>Note, you can share whole folders this way as well.</li>
  <li>Click on the Links link in the files list and Dropbox shows all the files
    and folders that you have linked and when. If other people have shared
    with you, click on the From others link to see those files and folders:</li>
  <!------------Diagram-02.03.04------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/020304sharing.png">
</ol>
<p>This sharing process is a particularly good method for distributing photos
  and videos without having to attach copies to email, for example.</p>
  
  <!------------SubSection-02.03.07------------>
  <h2><a name="020307">Versions</a></h2>
<p>If you upload an updated version of a document that already exists in
  your Dropbox files then the old version is saved and is replaced by the
  new upload.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Upload the same document twice.</li>
  <li>Select the document entry in the files list.</li>
  <li>Click the More tool:</li>
  <!------------Diagram-02.03.05------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/020305links.png">
  <li>Select Previous versions. Dropbox will show a list of previous versions
    of the document.</li>
  <li>If you want to revert to one of the previous versions, click the radio
    button on the left and click the Restore button. Dropbox creates a new
    version being a copy of the previous document you selected, the old latest
    version is retained.</li>
</ol>
<p>Dropbox therefore retains all the document changes as you work on different
  versions.</p>
  
<!------------SubSection-02.03.08------------>
<h2>
  <a name="020308">Synchronized local files</a>
</h2>
<p>You can only do this section if you are running on your own laptop or
  desktop computer. Skip this section if you are using a public computer.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download the Dropbox server by visiting https://www.dropbox.com/downloading
    where the app will start downloading and you receive instructions about
    installation.</li>
  <li>Once installed the Dropbox server will prompt you for your Dropbox account
    and ask for the folder to store the local copies of your Dropbox files.
    It is safe to choose the defaults.</li>
  <li>When the Dropbox server is running it displays an icon in the usual taskbars
    on Mac and PC. Right clicking (clicking on Mac) on the icon reveals:</li>
    <!------------Diagram-02.03.06----------->
    <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/020306move.png">
  <li>Click on the Dropbox Folder to see the contents of your local Dropbox
    folder which after the initial downloads will always mirror the files you
    at Dropbox.com in the browser.</li>
  <li>From this point on you can just work with your local Dropbox folder and
    any additions, deletions and changes to files or folders will be synchronized
    in your Dropbox Cloud. Remember for synchronization to occur your device
    must be connected to the Internet. However you can still work offline and
    Dropbox automatically resyncs when you have an Internet connection again.</li>
</ol>

<!------------SubSection-02.03.09------------>
<h2>
  <a name="020309">Other features</a>
</h2>
<p class="runinheading">
  <em>Events</em>: The Events link on the left of the Dropbox files list shows
  a complete log of all the activity that has taken place in your Dropbox
  account since it was created. You can limit the list to a particular date
  and narrow it down to your shared folders as well. This last feature allows
  you to monitor team activity on a shared folder.</p>
<p class="runinheading">
  <em>Get more space</em>: Clicking on the Get free space link shows you ways
  you can either purchase more storage space or accumulate free space by
  spreading the word to friends via email and social media.</p>
  
<!------------SubSection-02.03.10------------>
<h2>
  <a name="020310">For the survey</a>
</h2>
<p>In a later survey a question will ask you to enter the link of one of
  your photos/images you uploaded on Dropbox in one of the steps above. Use
  the Get link feature to copy the web link to your clipboard in readiness
  to paste into your survey answer.</p>
 
 <!------------Section-03.01------------>
 <h1><a name="0301">Cloud Office Apps</a></h1>
<p>In this section I describe Cloud Office apps, the current pinnacle of
  Cloud services. By Cloud Office apps I mean sites that allow you to create
  and edit documents in the common Microsoft Office formats such as Word,
  Excel and PowerPoint. All processing is done in the Cloud without the need
  to install local Office apps on your devices.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-03.01.01------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/030101apps.png">
<p>I am going to cover Google Drive in this lecture and Microsoft OneDrive
  in the workshop You won’t be surprised to learn that both Google Drive
  and OneDrive also offer Cloud storage services to store the Office documents.
  As such they form a useful comparison to Dropbox in the Cloud storage services
  area.</p>
  <!------------Diagram-03.01.02------------>
  <img class="diagram" src="diagrams/030102gapps.png">
<p>With a Google account, a Gmail account for example, you go to drive.google.com
  to access your Google drive. There you see a list of your documents in
  the Cloud with the usual abilities to upload, manage and share them. Google
  Drive adds powerful features to create new documents, spreadsheets, presentations
  and drawings. Drive uses its own proprietary format for documents but is
  able to import and export the standard Microsoft formats for Word, Excel
  and PowerPoint.</p>
<!------------Diagram-03.01.03------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/030103doc.png">
<p>Here we see the Cloud storage workshop document which I created with Microsoft
  Word 2013. I uploaded this document to Drive and Google is able to store
  and display it correctly. Drive can also rename, move to a folder, download
  and print this document. Because the document is in Microsoft .docx format,
  it cannot be edited by Drive until it is converted into the special format
  used by Google.</p>
<!------------Diagram-03.01.04------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/030104create.png">
<p>In contrast a Google document created in Drive has full editing capability
  within the browser and allows fairly sophisticated documents to be prepared.
  Drive then offers an extensive range of formats in which to download this
  document. In the list the .docx and PDF formats are probably the most useful.</p>
<!------------Diagram-03.01.05------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/030105otherapps.png">
<p>The same holds true for Google Presentations, Sheets and Drawings. All
  these Google Office apps offer an increasingly extensive range of editing
  features, and all can export documents in the equivalent Microsoft Office
  format.</p>

<p>The steps in this workshop take you through setting up a Microsoft account,
  if you don’t have one already. Then you will use OneDrive to create some
  Office documents in the Cloud. You can share these documents amongst your
  devices and other users.</p>
<p>Carry out the steps on your own laptop or desktop if possible to obtain

<h2>
  <a name="030202">Establish a Microsoft Account</a>
</h2>
<p>If you already have a Microsoft account skip this section.</p>
<p>When creating a new Microsoft account in order to complete this workshop
  bear in mind you may become a permanent OneDrive user, so create a sensible
  Microsoft email address. I recommend you chose something like myusername@outlook.com.</p>
<ol>
  <li>In a browser go to https://onedrive.com and click the link to Sign up
    and/or Sign up now to take you to the Create an account form.</li>
  <li>Your name, new password, birth date and gender are required. Click on
    the ‘Or get a new email address’ link to force an xxxx@outlook.com address.</li>
  <li>Overcoming the Microsoft captcha to prove you are not a robot is notoriously
    difficult. Generate a new one or use the audio feature to read the characters
    to you.</li>
  <li>Uncheck the promotional email offers checkbox. You will receive a welcome
    email in your new Microsoft account inbox. If not directed there, go to
    https://onedrive.com, login and click the down arrow alongside OneDrive
    at the top left and navigate to Outlook.com:</li>
    <!------------Diagram-03.02.01------------>

<p>Note this Cloud service combines, email, contacts (People), calendar as
  well as OneDrive which itself provides Cloud storage and Office apps which
  are called Office Online.</p>

<!------------SubSection-03.02.03------------>
<h2>
  <a name="030203">Create a folder</a>
</h2>
<p>The OneDrive Cloud storage uses folders in the conventional way. When
  you login to OneDrive you are positioned at the top level folder called
  something like Fred’s OneDrive. To create a folder:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on the Create link then click on Folder.</li>
  <li>Type in a folder name like ‘Office Documents’ and click the Create link.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the new folder is created click on its name to be positioned within
  that folder. Its name and a breadcrumb list like Fred’s OneDrive > Office
  Documents will appear.</p>
<!------------SubSection-03.02.04------------>
<h2>
  <a name="030204">Upload documents</a>

<p>Position yourself in the folder of your choice and decide on a document
  to upload. Even on a public computer there will be files that you can upload,
  or you may have a USB drive plugged in with your own files stored.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use the Upload link to upload at least a Word document, and Excel spreadsheet
    and a PowerPoint presentation document to OneDrive.</li>

<p>Clicking on one of your uploaded Office documents will take you to the
  appropriate Office Online App. [If your computer has a local installation
  of Office you will need to click on EDIT DOCUMENT and select Edit in Word
  Online.] The document opens in the browser and presents you with a significant
  set of editing tools in the familiar ribbon layout. This workshop document
  was prepared with Microsoft Word 2013 on a desktop, and after upload to
  OneDrive further editing can be carried out:</p>

  <a name="0401">Other Cloud Services</a>
</h1>
<p>Having concentrated on just the most popular Cloud services I draw to
  a close by looking at other services. An exhaustive list in such a short
  course is not possible but it is important to give an impression of how
  extensive the Cloud has become.</p>
<p>To a greater or lesser extent I have covered off email, Cloud storage,
  collections of media files like photos, music and video, and Cloud Office
  apps. Let us look at the other services mentioned earlier.</p>
<!------------Diagram-04.01.01------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/040101social.png">
<p>By their very nature, social media sites are quintessential examples of
  Cloud services. Users of a social media site see content generated by themselves
  and a controlled selection of other users, referred to as friends. Content
  comes in many and varied forms and spans text, links, photos, audio and
  video of all kinds, as well as interactive content in the form of games.</p>
<p>It is the vast array of content that makes social media sites so attractive,
  so much so that we see social media starting to take viewing time away
  from other media like TV. Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn are the big three
  social media sites. I am sure you a familiar with Facebook. Twitter supports
  short 140-character messages and allows one-way friendships – you can friend
  me but I don’t have to reciprocate. LinkedIn has become the professional
  social media network and is the place to establish your central resume,
  where employers and professionals go to assess your skills and experience.</p>
<p>Google is late to the game with Google plus and is finding traction with
  technically oriented people. Instagram shares photos amongst its users.
  Foursquare encourages you to share your checkins at locations of your choice.
  WhatsApp users pass messages to each other, and Pinterest simulates pinning
  and sharing your photo messages on a pinboard.</p>
<p>The only major concern with social media is how much personal information
  to impart and with whom. Avoid the inevitable peer pressure to share more
  than you intend.</p>
<!------------Diagram-04.01.02------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/040102data.png">
<p>Remember structured data collections are really online databases. These
  Cloud services allow you to create collections of data records specific
  to a task or topic. The data is either typed in manually or copied from
  the web or email.</p>
<p>The Diigo service collects web address links, bookmarks, and allows you
  to associate notes and tags and control sharing for each link. You can
  create folders to structure your link collection. Stored in this way the
  Cloud service can provide intelligent searching to find the data conveniently
  in the future. Being in the Cloud you can do this from any device.</p>
<p>Mendeley provides storage for references and can generate lists of citations.
  All references can be shared and Mendeley is invaluable for authors of
  professional documents.</p>
<p>The third window shows Feedly, which manages your collection of RSS feeds
  used by online news services and blogs. Feedly is essentially an RSS feed
  reader and provides a constantly updated list of only the new information
  from your chosen collection of news sites or blogs – in essence a 'river
  of news'.</p>
<p>I have just given a tiny sample of the types of data available. Whatever
  your interest you will find structured data collections to suit – movies,
  music, books, magazines, newspapers, sports, and so on.</p>
<!------------Diagram-04.01.03------------>

<p>Many of you will have been using the Cloud to access your bank accounts
  securely for many years. The banks have become expert in providing secure
  transactions via the Cloud, most recently on smartphones, too. But we are
  seeing the emergence of Cloud-only financial services.</p>
<p>Probably the biggest and most well-known is PayPal now owned by the Ebay
  online shopping company. PayPal allows money in a wide range of currencies
  to be transferred between any two users, individuals or companies, with
  PayPal accounts. A PayPal account is just an email address. If you know
  my address you can send me money, and vice versa, so much easier than dealing
  with bank accounts. However, the traditional banks do back up each PayPal
  user account with credit cards. PayPal though, can be used on any device
  via the browser or dedicated apps.</p>
<p>Google Wallet is less popular but offers many of the same features as
  PayPal. The Apple Passbook app, which is supported only on Apple devices,
  extends transactions from just money to tickets, vouchers and loyalty cards
  and other objects of monetary worth. Square is an interesting company that
  provides a small credit card reading device on your smartphone or tablet
  and allows you to accept a credit card payment anywhere. This company is
  also experimenting with a payment by email service even easier to use than
  PayPal.</p>
<p>Financial services in the Cloud are growing fast and threaten to overtake
  traditional banking services.</p>
<p>And the list goes on. I have not mentioned industries like travel, food
  and drink, entertainment, sports and the professional services of the law,
  education and government. All are offering Cloud services growing fast
  from small beginnings.</p>

<h1>
  <a name="0402">Embrace the Cloud</a>
</h1>
<p>In these closing remarks I leave you with some parting thoughts. As I
  hope you now know, the Cloud is vast and I have only scratched the surface
  of what it can do for all of us.</p>
<!------------Diagram-04.02.01------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/040201summary.png">
<p>These are the concepts I hope you will hold in your mind whenever you
  think about the Cloud, or other people seek your opinions about it. The
  three benefits are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You can access thousands of Cloud services from billions of devices.</li>
  <li>The Cloud offers a single, safe place to store documents and data.</li>
  <li>You can share documents with everyone or anyone in particular.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are very significant benefits. But offsetting these are some pitfalls:</p>
<ol>
  <li>An always-on Internet connection is best, but you can still use the Cloud
    with occasional interruptions to Internet service.</li>
  <li>You must trust your Cloud service provider to keep the service running
    and backup your data.</li>
  <li>Security of data transfer and data storage is vital, and the Cloud can
    offer both.</li>
</ol>
<!------------Diagram-04.02.02------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/040202balance.png">
<p>The continuing growth in availability and use of Cloud services points
  to the benefits outweighing the pitfalls. This is particularly true for
  individuals, professionals and small businesses. And by individuals I mean
  both young and old alike I believe you are never too old to use the Cloud.</p>
<!------------Diagram-04.02.03------------>
<img class="diagram" src="diagrams/040202aid.png">
<p>For those of you who have used the Cloud already I hope you learned a
  few new facts of interest to you. For those of you new to the Cloud I hope
  it has encouraged you to begin using the Cloud for at least some of you
  computing needs. In relation to the Cloud and You I urge you to go forward
  boldly and Embrace the Cloud.</p>

<p>I prefer not to give static references to further reading as the developements
  in the Cloud are so frequent that such information is superceded well before
  a reader is able to follow up. Instead a link is provided to a Diigo list
  of references which are updated from time to time to reflect at least the
  significant changes to Cloud information. The dynamic references list can
